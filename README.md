# boulder

This project's goal is simply to allow rock climbers to log in and log their climbs and be shown stats about their climbing such as how hard they've climbed in a given time frame, or the hardest/easiest routes they've done in a given time frame.
A lot of the features aren't fleshed out yet but simply sketches/pseudocode on a scratch sheet.

Boulder is a simple PHP project involving user authentication/log in system, database and various API end points such as delete.php and register.php.

I welcome any contributions to help develop the UX/UI/Front end or refactor anything or add features such as filtered searching, viewing other people's climbs, etc.  Come gain and help me gain experience while contributing to an open-source project.
