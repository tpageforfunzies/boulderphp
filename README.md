# Bouldertracker

This project's goal is simply to allow rock climbers to log in and log their climbs and be shown stats about their climb
ing such as how hard they've climbed in a given time frame, or the hardest/easiest routes they've done in a given time 
frame.  Over time the plan is to add some social media functions such as viewing others climbs, commenting on other 
peoples climbs, and making a customizable user profile page. 

Boulder is a simple PHP project that is slowly getting fully fleshed out.

I welcome any contributions to help develop the UX/UI/Front-end or refactor anything or add features.  On the to-do list
 currently is a page with a list of all users so users can reference emails, password recovery/changing, commenting on 
 other's climbs, and customizable user profile pages.  
 
 To-do List:
<ul>
    <li>Commenting on other people's climbs</li>
    <li>Customizable user profile pages</li>
    <li>Password Recovery/Changing</li>
    <li>Write front-ends for iOS and Android</li>
</ul>
