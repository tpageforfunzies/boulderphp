# boulder

This project's goal is simply to allow rock climbers to log in and log their climbs and be shown stats about their climbing such as how hard they've climbed in a given time frame, or the hardest/easiest routes they've done in a given time frame.  Over time the plan is to add some social media functions such as viewing others climbs, commenting on other peoples climbs, and making a customizable user profile page. 

Boulder is a simple PHP project that is slowly getting fully fleshed out.

I welcome any contributions to help develop the UX/UI/Front-end or refactor anything or add features.  On the to-do list currently is a page with a list of all users so users can reference emails, password recovery/changing, commenting on other's climbs, and customizable user profile pages.
